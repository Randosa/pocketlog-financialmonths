"""Tests for the usage counts behind the booking modal's category chooser.

``GET /api/categories`` gained the same shape ``GET /api/tags`` already had:
a ``count`` over a recent window (``crud.CATEGORY_COUNT_WINDOW_DAYS``) plus
``count_in``/``count_out`` splitting it by transaction type.

The chooser shows only the top two rows of chips and reaches the rest through
search, so this ranking is what decides whether the everyday booking is a
single tap. That makes the window and the split worth pinning.
